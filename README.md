# üåê **Wi-Fi Network Activity Monitor & Device Discovery**

## üì° **Overview**

Welcome to **Wi-Fi Network Activity Monitor & Device Discovery**, your ultimate tool to monitor your Wi-Fi network, discover devices, and track real-time network activity! üöÄ Whether you're an IT pro, network administrator, or just curious about your home network, this tool gives you deep insights into connected devices and their activity.

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Key Features**
- **Wi-Fi Network Discovery**: Scan for available Wi-Fi networks and select one to monitor.
- **Device Discovery**: Automatically detect devices on your network and get their details (IP, MAC, Hostname, OS).
- **Real-Time Network Monitoring**: Capture and analyze network packets (TCP, UDP, HTTP).
- **Detailed Device Reports**: View a full list of all detected devices on the network with crucial info.
- **Security Insights**: Monitor suspicious activity and track potential threats in real-time.

## üîß **Requirements**

Before using the tool, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed
- **Libraries**:
    - `scapy` (for packet sniffing and network discovery)
    - `colorama` (to beautify terminal output)
    - `nmap` (to detect operating systems of devices)
    - `os` (for OS interaction)
    - `platform` (to detect system type and adjust commands)

To install the required libraries, simply run:

```bash
pip install scapy colorama

üöÄ Installation Steps

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/wifi-network-activity-monitor.git

Navigate into the project folder:

cd wifi-network-activity-monitor

Run the tool:

    python wifi_activity_tracker.py

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Step 1: Wi-Fi Network Discovery

    The tool starts by scanning all available Wi-Fi networks in your area.
    A list of networks will be displayed for you to choose from.

Step 2: Device Discovery

    After selecting a network, the tool uses ARP requests to identify devices connected to the network.
    For each device, it captures important information like:
        üñß IP Address
        üè∑Ô∏è MAC Address
        üè† Hostname
        üñ•Ô∏è Operating System

Step 3: Real-Time Network Activity Monitoring

    The tool listens for network traffic and logs packets in real time.
    It captures and displays the following details:
        üì° Protocol (TCP, UDP, HTTP)
        üè∑Ô∏è Source & Destination IPs
        üåê HTTP Requests (hostnames and paths)
        üõ†Ô∏è Port Scanning Results (for security monitoring)

Step 4: Generate Device Report

    A summary report of all devices on the network is compiled.
    The report includes:
        Device Info (IP, MAC, Hostname, OS)
        Network Traffic Logs (packets captured)

üìã Sample Output
Wi-Fi Network Discovery:

[INFO] Scanning available Wi-Fi networks...

Available Wi-Fi Networks:
1. Network_A
2. Network_B
3. Network_C

Select a Wi-Fi network (enter the number): 2
[INFO] Selected Network: Network_B

Device Discovery:

[INFO] Discovering devices on network: 192.168.1.0/24

[INFO] Devices found on the network:
IP: 192.168.1.5 | MAC: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E | Hostname: device1.local | OS: Linux
IP: 192.168.1.6 | MAC: 00:1B:3C:4D:5E:6F | Hostname: device2.local | OS: Windows

Real-Time Network Activity:

[INFO] Packet: 192.168.1.5 --> 192.168.1.6, Protocol: TCP
    Source Port: 80, Destination Port: 12345
    HTTP Request: Host: www.example.com, Path: /home

üìú Logging and Reports

The tool logs all captured data into a file named network_activity_log.txt. The log includes:

    Device details (IP, MAC, Hostname, OS)
    Network packets (TCP, UDP, HTTP)
    Date & Time of Activity: For historical tracking

You can review the file to analyze network activity over time.
üìù Usage Tips

    Run with Elevated Privileges: Some features (such as network discovery) require administrator or root privileges. Use sudo on Linux/macOS or run as Administrator on Windows.

    sudo python wifi_activity_tracker.py

    Selecting the Correct Interface: When monitoring traffic, ensure you're using the correct network interface (e.g., wlan0 for Wi-Fi).

    Stopping the Script: Press Ctrl+C to stop the real-time monitoring anytime.
